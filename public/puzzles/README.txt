Place the Gallery Pair photos here:

- q4_a.webp  (the 4-letter title image, e.g. SNOW)
- q4_b.webp  (the 3-letter title image, e.g. SOW)

These are loaded by the app at runtime from:
- /puzzles/q4_a.webp
- /puzzles/q4_b.webp

If the files are missing or 404, the app will show stylized fallback paintings instead.
