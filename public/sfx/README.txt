Drop optional “loot box” sound effects in this folder to level up taps and the gift opening.

If these files are missing, the app will fall back to the built-in procedural SFX (so nothing breaks).

## Expected filenames (recommended: .mp3 for iOS Safari)
- gift_open.mp3
- loot_tap_1.mp3
- loot_tap_2.mp3
- loot_tap_3.mp3
- loot_jackpot.mp3

## Where they’re used
- gift_open.mp3: when you tap “Open your gift” on the letter (page 3)
- loot_tap_*.mp3: every tap on the present
- loot_jackpot.mp3: the final “jackpot” tap/open moment on the present

## License note
Please only use sounds you have the right to use (CC0 / public domain / properly licensed).
